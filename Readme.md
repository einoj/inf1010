This repository contains answers to obligatory exercises to the UiO course inf1010 object oriented programming in Java. There is however a twist... The answers to the problems have been written in C++ in order to teach myself the programming language. Test programs were provided by the course holders provided test programs written in Java which I also translated into C++.

I choose this way of learning C++ because I took the Java course in 2011, the questions were reasonably complex, long, and interesting. I also wanted to learn C++ in an object oriented setting, as it is one of the main reasons for me to use it over ANSI C.
